# Blog Post Draft — Launch (Week 1) v1
_Last updated: 2025-12-19_

**Title:** Introducing GSV Agent Store: Outcomes, on autopilot  
**Subtitle:** A marketplace of AI workers you can run in minutes — priced with credits you control.

## Why we built this
Teams are drowning in repeat work. AI can help, but only if it’s safe, predictable, and easy to adopt.

## What you can do today
- Pick an outcome (Support, Sales, Ops…)
- Try a bundle with free credits
- Connect your tools
- Run instantly (or deploy a web widget)

## Why credits
Credits keep spend predictable, and let you compare “work done” across bundles.

## What’s next
We’ll ship new bundles weekly and expand integrations continuously.
