# Buyer Journey & Experience Maps — Frictionless App Store MVP

**Date:** 2025-12-17

## Principles
1. Browse without login
2. Try with free credits
3. Connect apps only when required
4. Upgrade/top-up only when blocked
5. Always show credits/spend
6. One-click activation

## Stage Map
- **Discover:** search + filters (value stream, capabilities, connectors, language, modality)
- **Evaluate:** listing shows required connectors + estimated credits + trust/security notes
- **Try:** “Run now” → auto org/project → starter credits → minimal form
- **Connect:** connector wizard only when tool required
- **Buy:** plan upgrade or credit pack top-up
- **Activate:** instance created and ready
- **Use:** workspace shows wallet, usage, history
- **Retain:** low credit warning, upgrade suggestions

## Minimum screens
1) Home (categories + value streams) — Wagtail + Saleor embeds
2) Category listing — Saleor
3) Value stream landing pages — Wagtail
4) Listing detail — Saleor + “Run now”
5) Workspace — Control Plane UI (instances, run, wallet, connectors)
6) Checkout/top-up — Saleor
